# RT2_1st_assignment
# Purpose
This is the repository for rt2_1st_assignment. The author is Yusuke Kido. This assignment is composed of 3 parts:Documentation, jupyter notebook, and Statistics.

# Documentation
I modulated "menu.py" developed in the final assignment in RT1.
You can check my documentation in this URL (file:///root/ros_ws/src/final_assignment/docs/html/menu_8py.html).

# jupyter notebook
I developed "mode.py" and "jupy.ipynb." for making the UI to control the robot car.

# statistics
I did the required experiment and wrote the report on the results of it in "RT2.pdf."
Also, the movie in the experiment is shown below. I recommend you that you should change the resolution into 1080p.
